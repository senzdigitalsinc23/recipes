This project entails creating a recipe.

After this lesson in the project, I would have demonstrated basic html skills such as,

* Setting up HTML boilerplate
* working with various html elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, em, strong, list etc.

This is phase 1 of the project. (Only project skeleton)
